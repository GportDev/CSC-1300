# CPU

Fetchs, decodes and executes program instructions (BRAIN)

1. **Control Unit**: <br/>
Retrieves and decodes program instructions, coordinates activities of all parts of the computer
2. **Arithmetic & logic unit**: <br/> 
High speed numerical calculations <br/>
True/false, yes/no decision

### Power wall

Computers with one CPU limits how fast the computer can run, but with more transistors on a chip, more dense it be and more energy it consumes, also, this radiates more heat.

The solution was to make multi-core processors that are several mini processos working together acting like one single.

So, many instructions can be executed at the same time if there are more then one processor (Parallel computing or Parallel programming)

### Main memory

Circuit that can store 0s and 1s in addressed locations
They are divided in equal sections <br/>
Each section is **1 byte** = 8 bits = 1 char/letter

### What is programming

Basically is problem solving using machines/softwares. It's consists in an algorithm (sequence of steps) methodically set to solve a specific problem.
